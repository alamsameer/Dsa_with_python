# If every element in the sorted array were to appear exactly twice, they would occur in pairs at indices i, i+1 for all even i.

# Equivalently, nums[i] = nums[i+1] and nums[i+1] != nums[i+2] for all even i.

# When we insert the unique element into this list, the indices of all the pairs following it will be shifted by one, negating the above relationship.

# So, for any even index i, we can compare nums[i] to nums[i+1].

# If they are equal, the unique element must occur somewhere after index i+1
# If they aren't equal, the unique element must occur somewhere before index i+1
# Using this knowledge, we can use binary search to find the unique element.

# We just have to make sure that our pivot index is always even, so we can use mid = 2 * ((lo + hi) // 4) instead of the usual mid = (lo + hi) // 2.
