# using + operator with num aand string  in python give error  but in js will add both as string 
# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x + y)  will give  error 

#  Global variable in pythonare created 
# outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables

# x=" i am global "
# def myFunc():
#     x=" i am local"
#     print("see python "+x)
# myFunc()

# If you create a variable with the same name inside a function,
#  this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value
# print(x)

# using  global  keyword to change a global variable inside function 
# def lfunc():
#     global x 
#     x =" here i am changed inside func"
# lfunc()
# print(x)
