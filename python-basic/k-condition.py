#  logics in python 
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b


a=20
b=3
# if b>a:
#     print("b is greater")
# else:
#     print("a is greater")

#  --- shorthand  for  if 
# if a>b:print("tasneem is taller than sameer")

# --- shorthand for  if else
# print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

# ----if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error
